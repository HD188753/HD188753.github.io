Hi. 
My name is Andrew Slomski.
I'm currently a freshmen attending Wilmington Friends Upper School.
I am attempting to learn more about the internet and web design via expimentation on my own website.
I aim to design a minimalistic UI for a blog on varrying topics, mainly PC games.
I am quite new to Git so I am still becoming acclimated to the concepts and deep command system that Git supports.
My website name is "Turbo-Octo-Happiness" as it aims to provide eight, quick articles per day that leaves the reader off with a positive note.
Thanks for reading,
- Andrew.
